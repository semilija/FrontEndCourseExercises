        <h2>The Internet</h2>
            <p>
            The Internet is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible. 
            <br>
            The Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together.

            <h2> How does the Internet work </h2>
            <p>
            The internet works by connecting a huge number of computers all across the world in an interactive 
            <br>
            network that allows them to send and receive packets of information. The internet is a connected 
            <br>
            network of individual computers that send and receive information thousands of times every minute.

        <h2>Internet Protocols</h2>
            <p>
            The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams 
            <br>
            across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.

        <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
            <p>
            Internet Protocol and Transmission Control Protocol are communication protocols that define how 
            <br>
            data should travel across the Internet. This is like the transport mechanisms 
            <br>
            that let you place an order, go to the shop and buy stuff.

        <h2>DNS</h2>
            <p>
            DNS - Domain Name Servers are like address book for websites. When you type a web address in the browser, 
            <br>
            the browser looks at the DNS to find the websites real address before it can retrieve the website. 
            <br>
            The browser needs to find out which server the website lives on 
            <br>
            so i can send HTTP messages to the right place.

            The format in which the data is sent from server to client. When data is sent across the web, 
            <br>
            it is send as thousands of small chunks, so that many different web users can download 
            <br>
            the same website at the same time.

        <h2>HTTP</h2>
            <p>
            The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia 
            <br>
            information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents 
            <br>
            include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example 
            <br>
            by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.

        <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>
            The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed
            <br>
            to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as 
            <br>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        <h2>Routers</h2>
            <p>
            A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic 
            <br>
            directing functions on the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email,
            <br>
            is in the form of data packets. A packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router 
            <br>
            through the networks that constitute an internetwork (e.g. the Internet)
            <br>
            until it reaches its destination node.
